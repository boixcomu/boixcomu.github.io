I've always found other people blog's fascinating and interesting. 
On one side, engineering blogs inspired me on developping personal projects and helped me to overcome similar dificulties as the ones related. On the other side, personal blogs have some early internet feel that now, while I'm rethinking my internet presence, have some appeal to me. 
But more important, i feel i need a space to document some technical projects to remember how to do them :P

I still don't know which will be the structure of the site, or if there will be. I have some ideas, but few time to implement them in short notice. For starting i'd like to iclude multi-language in here.

To create the site I adapted the [Feeling Responsible][1] theme and by now not all the links are changed. So be nice with me, the site is still in alpha version. I expect to work on it soon.

See you in the next post.

Here you have the expected hello world.

~~~~cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
~~~~
