Keeping with the feeling of always arriving late to the party I decided to start my personal blog. I always felt inspired by other people sharings when developping my projects and its time to break my technical shyness and share what I'm doing. 

I still don't know which will be the structure of the site, or if there will be. At least i hope it helps me to remember what i've been doing.
'''
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
'''
